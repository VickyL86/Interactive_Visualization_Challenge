# Interactive_Visualization_Challenge

The assignment involved creating an interactive dashboard based on the API dataset - http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ - with the use of JavaSript.  
Visualizations were prepared with the use of D3 library. 

Published dashboard allows exploring individual observations from the dataset via dropdown. Each obervation is represented with the following elements:
- summary table with individual metadata detail
- barchart showing 10 most obundant cultures present in each subject
- bubble chart representing all present cultures with respective frequencies
- frequency gauge showing washing frequency
